			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>Five Galaxy Alliance space explorers named Keith, Lance, Pidge, Hunk and Sven come upon Planet Arus which has been ravaged by the evil King Zarkon's forces. When they arrive, they are captured and taken to Planet Doom, where they are imprisoned. After their escape, they head back to Arus.</p>

			<p>After making it to the ruins of the Castle of Lions, they convince the beautiful Princess Allura and her advisor, Coran, to allow them to seek out the five Lions of Voltron. From then on, they are known as the Voltron Force and eventually succeed in driving Zarkon's forces back with Voltron's help.</p>

			<p>The Voltron Force continues to focus on the struggle to keep Arus free and secure from Zarkon's rules.</p>

			<h2>Keith</h2>

			<p>Keith is the most level-headed member of Voltron Force. As Captain, he always puts the safety of his friends and planet Arus as first priority. He has feelings for Allura, which often distracts him from the task at hand. Dressed in red, Keith pilots the Black Lion, which makes up Voltron's head.</p>

			<h2>Lance</h2>

			<p>Standing 2nd in command, Lance is a bit of a hothead. He always has a snappy punch line or speedy pun about the enemies the Force has to fight. Dressed in blue, this member of the Voltron Force pilots the Red Lion, making up the right arm of Voltron.</p>

			<h2>Pidge</h2>

				<h2>Sven</h2>

				<p>Sven was one of the original members of Voltron Force, serving as navigator and piloting the Blue Lion. However, after a battle with the evil witch Haggar early in the series, Sven was so badly injured that he was taken to the medical planet of Ebb. He later fell in love with Allura's distant cousin, Princess Romelle of Planet Pollux.</p>

				<h2>Princess Allura</h2>

				<p>Allura is the princess of the planet Arus, and her father, King Alfor, died in a battle with Zarkon. While at times, she seems naive, when called on, she can be one of the bravest on the team. Sven piloted the Blue Lion before her, but was severely injured by the witch Haggar, so Allura took his place. Allura has a crush on Keith and can be seen eyeing him and blushing when he's around.</p>
